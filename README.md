First project for CompSci 308 Spring 2016

Name: Roxanne Baker

Date started: 1/7/2016 (started working on it early once Prof. Duvall emailed us the assignment)

Date finished: 1/24/2016

Hours worked: ~60 (hard to say, I have no idea how much time I spent on it before class officially started)

Resources used: Images from Pokemon Red/Blue and Pokemon Gold/Silver
Referenced http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/introduction-to-javafx-for-game-development--cms-23835
for basic ideas and regularly referenced the API for several javaFX classes.
Story was based on an outline for a Murder Mystery Party found here: http://homepage.ntlworld.com/j.coutts1/Hollywood_info.htm

Main class file: PlayGame

Data (non Java) files needed: The images that are attached.  "Character Sprites" contains the sprites for all non-player characters, but there are several other images as well that are not in a folder.

How to play the game:  Navigate the world, talking to NPCs and looking around houses for clues to solve the mystery.  Buy/sell items to help you fight against wild animals when travelling between towns.  When you feel you've solved the mystery, accuse that person of being the murderer and beat them in a final showdown.

Keys/Mouse input: No mouse input.  Arrow keys for movement, scrolling textboxes, and navigating menus
"I" to open inventory.
"B" to go back in a menu.

Cheat Keys: "V" during a battle will instantly reduce the enemies health to 0, so you automatically win with your next move

Known bugs: Sometimes moving around an NPC will move the player character into a nearby building/forest patch.
This can also happen if the game is slow, and sometimes the input seems delayed (this seemed to improve when I refactored the code shortly before submission but I did not have sufficient time to test and see how well the problem was resolved)

Extra features: Mostly what was mentioned in the DESIGN.txt, except the player can accuse other NPCs of being the murderer from the beginning of the game

Impressions/Suggestions:  It was a lot of fun and I learned a lot.  A lot of work, too, but most of that came from my desire to create a "complete" game even after having met the official requirements.
